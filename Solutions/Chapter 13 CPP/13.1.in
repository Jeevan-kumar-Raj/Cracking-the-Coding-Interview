
“Even when I was a boy I could never walk in a wood without feeling that at any moment
 I might find before me somebody or something I had long looked for without knowing what I looked for.
 And now I will at times explore every little nook of some poor coppice with almost anxious footsteps, 
 so deep a hold has this imagination upon me.
 You too meet with a like imagination, doubtless, somewhere, wherever your ruling stars will have it,
 Saturn driving you to the woods, or the Moon, it may be, to the edges of the sea.
 I will not of a certainty believe that there is nothing in the sunset,
 where our forefathers imagined the dead following their shepherd the sun, or nothing but some vague presence as little moving as nothing.
 If beauty is not a gateway out of the net we were taken in at our birth, it will not long be beauty,
 and we will find it better to sit at home by the fire and fatten a lazy body or to run hither and thither 
 in some foolish sport than to look at the finest show that light and shadow ever made among green leaves.
 I say to myself, when I am well out of that thicket of argument, that they are surely there, the divine people,
 for only we who have neither simplicity nor wisdom have denied them, 
 and the simple of all times and the wise men of ancient times have seen them and even spoken to them.” 
 ― W.B. Yeats, The Celtic Twilight
